# FAQ Entries Configuration
# This file defines semantic FAQ entries for automatic chat responses
#
# How it works:
# 1. When a viewer sends a message, it's compared against these FAQ questions
# 2. If the message is semantically similar (above the threshold), Pedro responds automatically
# 3. The response is generated naturally by the LLM using the cached response as context
#
# Usage:
#   faq sync --config configs/faq/entries.yaml
#
# Notes:
# - Question text is used to generate embeddings for semantic matching
# - Keep questions conversational and similar to how viewers might ask
# - Cooldowns prevent spam (in seconds)
# - Categories are for organization only

# Embedding model used for generating question embeddings
# IMPORTANT: If you change this model, run 'faq sync' to regenerate all embeddings
embedding_model: "text-embedding-3-small"

# Minimum cosine similarity score to trigger a response
# Higher = more strict matching, lower = more lenient
# Recommended range: 0.70-0.85
similarity_threshold: 0.75

# Default cooldown for entries that don't specify one (in seconds)
default_cooldown_seconds: 300
